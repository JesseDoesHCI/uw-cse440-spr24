        <p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial paper prototype that will begin to allow testing of your design.</p>
        <p>Develop a paper prototype for your design.
        It should convey critical components of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Include an overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>

          <li>The prototype should be complete for each task,
          including enough detail to show how to complete each step in the task.
          This should include the desired / expected / intended path, but also likely error conditions
          (e.g., what happens if some participant input is invalid?).</li>

          <li>The prototype should be at an appropriate level of detail,
          supporting understanding of critical components of your design and the context of the your primary tasks.</li>

          <li>The documentation in your report should explain how the components of your prototype are related.
          This should include detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This prototype has been informed by your prior sketching and storyboarding.
        But it also contains more details than your prior exploratory designs.
        If necessary or appropriate, revise your tasks or scenarios based on what you learn in prototyping.</p>

        <p>We recommend you do these on paper, then capture a high-quality image (e.g., avoid shadows).
        You may alternatively use an informal drawing tool,
        but be sure you do not adopt a tool that will start to embed unnecessary assumptions or decisions in your design process.</p>

        <p>If you use an informal drawing tool,
        you will need to have physical copies of your paper prototype throughout upcoming milestones.
        You will also need the ability to quickly iterate on your paper prototype.</p>

        <h4>Not Your Average Piece of Paper</h4>

        <p>This is not formally an EXtension Objective, but rather a tip that <b>this is a <i>great</i> assignment to put some extra effort into to get an EXP for an "EXceptional Submission"!</b></p>

        <p>Since everyone's paper prototypes will naturally look very different from each other, we can't really specify exactly what features would achieve this "extra mile"; but some features you might bake into your paper prototype to improve its quality include:</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b>Interactions that go beyond what you can usually do with paper,</b> e.g. incorporating update-able components via transparencies, post-its, etc.</p>
          <p><b>Clever representations of interactive UI elements,</b> e.g. a working carousel image display or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/pickers" target="_blank">Wheel Picker</a>.</p>
          <p><b>A supplemental component related to indicating the context of the interaction / representing real-world variables that exist beyond your interface</b>, e.g. depicting the current state of environment through an image backdrop.</p>
        </ul>

        <h5>Submission Details</h5>
        <p>If you choose to develop additional components beyond what's strictly required for the assignment, consider including a supplemental PDF document in your submission just highlighting these "Added Features", including details on how you implemented them, what they add to the prototype interaction, etc.</p>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to conduct heuristic evaluations as part of rapidly iterating on your paper prototype.</p>
        <p>You will receive an evaluation in class, and you will supplement this with another evaluation.</p>
        <p>In class, pair with another team to conduct heuristic evaluations.
          One team will conduct a heuristic evaluation of the other’s paper prototype, then the two teams will reverse roles.
          Each team will therefore conduct and receive one heuristic evaluation.</p>
        <p>We will provide a worksheet with Nielsen's heuristics:</p>
        <p><a href="/courses/cse440/24wi/assignments/3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf">3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf</a></p>
        <p>For each issue identified in evaluation, record:</p><ul>
          <li>The heuristic that is violated.</li>
          <li>A description of the usability issue, including an image of the relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
          <li>A severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in heuristic evaluation.
        Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.</p>
        <p>Outside of class, arrange to receive a second heuristic evaluation (e.g., with another team).
        You therefore received two heuristic evaluations of your paper prototype.
        If desired, you may also conduct a heuristic evaluation or cognitive walkthrough of your own paper prototype.</p>

          <h4>More Practice with Heuristics(2EXP)</h4>
  
          <p><strong>Part 1: identification.</strong> In class, we used and inspection based method to see if your prototypes violated any of Nielsen's heuristics. For this EXP, look at your current prototype and go through each of <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/24wi/assignments/3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf">Nielsen's heuristics</a>. For each heuristic, either 1. describe where your prototype violates the heuristic or 2. explain features of your design that adhere to the heuristic.</p>
  
          <p><strong>Part 2: incorperation.</strong> For 3 out of the 10 heuristics, either 1. address the problem that you identified in your current prototype, or 2. alter your design to even better adhere to the heuristic. Submit before and after screenshots of your prototype demonstrating the change along with a text description describing what you changed and how your design now better adheres to the heuristic.</p>
  
          <h5>Submission Details</h5>
          <p><strong> A list of each of the 10 heuristics, and how your prototype violates or adheres to the heuristic</strong>. This could be a bulleted list or table, really any readable format.</p>
          <p><strong> Screenshots of how you updated your prototype to better adhere to 3 of the 10 heuristics.</strong> See part 2 above for full specifications of what details to include.</p>
          </details>
        
        <h3>Submission Details</h3>
        <p>Records of your inspection-based methods will be submitted as part of later assignments (eg., see Assignment 3c).</p>
        <p>Be sure to keep detailed records, including images of relevant portions of the prototype before and after revisions.</p>

        <p><em>Note: This assignment is still under construction and updates on EXP will come soon.</em></p>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to document changes resulting from your inspection-based analyses and to begin usability testing of your revised prototype with participants.</p>
        <p>Complete one usability test with your paper prototype, examining your two primary tasks.</p>
        <p>Target an appropriate participant based on your design research and resulting design.</p>
        <p>Be sure to divide your team into roles when conducting a usability test.
          There is simply too much required for a single person to effectively conduct a test.
          As discussed in class, roles include the facilitator, the computer, and one or more observers.</p>
          <p>As part of your introduction, have your facilitator show the participant how to interact with your design.
          Do not show participants how to perform your tasks that you will later test.
          Instead show them how paper prototyping works, how your system generally works,
          and give an example of something specific that is sufficiently different from your tasks.</p>
          <p>During the test, record a log of critical incidents, including both positive and negative events.
          For example, a person might comment on something they like or might make a mistake in a task.
          Record the incident along with a description of the context of the incident.</p>
          <p>Consider recording your tests to allow you to see and show exactly what happened.
          If you do this, obtain permission from the participant and ensure your recording preserves the anonymity of the participant.
          Frame your shot such that you capture interaction with the prototype without unnecessarily capturing the participant.</p>
          <p>Each participant should perform both of your primary tasks.
          Keep the data separate for each participant and each task.
          Remember participation must be voluntary, participants should be free to stop at any time,
          and you should emphasize that your focus is on identifying usability issues in the design.</p>
          <p>Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in usability testing.
          This can and should include fixing major issues as soon as they are detected, before additional tests.
          Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.</p>
          <p>Present your iterative revisions and your plan going forward:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Present a table or list of results from your inspection-based methods.
          We expect you will report at least <strong>four</strong> identified issues and resulting revisions, which may be small or large.
          You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
          For each identified issue, include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>The heuristic that is violated.</li>
          <li>A description of the usability issue, including an image of the relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
          <li>A severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
          <li>An image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
          If you highlight an issue without revising in response to it, provide explanation of that decision.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Discuss your first usability test.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Provide a description of your testing method and participant
          (e.g., the participant, the environment where you conducted the test,
          why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol,
          and the roles of each team member who participated in the test).</li>
          <li>Discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself.
          This should include at least one part of your method that was especially effective
          or one revision you decided you need to make to your testing process.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Present a table or list of results from your first usability test.
          We expect you will report at least <strong>two</strong> identified incidents, which may be small or large.
          You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
          For each critical incident, include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
          <li>Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.</li>
          <li>For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
          <li>For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.</li>
          <li>For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Submit detailed images of your current paper prototype, as revised in this process.
          Your design may have changed more or less,
          so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
          As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each task.
          Include both:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>
          <li>Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Present your plan for the remainder of your usability tests.
          Describe what goals you have for the additional tests and any new approaches you will employ.
          You will conduct one usability test in section,
          describe your plans for recruiting an additional participant.</p>
          </li>
          </ul><p>As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
          you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of documenting those changes.
          Your goals in this documentation are to:</p><ul>
          <li>Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.</li>
          <li>Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and presentation.</li>
          </ul><p>You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document enough for these two goals.</p>
          <h3>Submission</h3>

        <p><em>Note: This assignment is still under construction and updates on EXP will come soon.</em></p>
        <p>The goal of this milestone is to complete usability testing of your prototype with participants.</p>
        <p>Complete a total of at least three usability tests and finalize your paper prototype according to what you learn.</p>
        <p>Present the results of your usability testing and your final paper prototype:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p>Discuss your three usability tests.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Provide a description of your testing method and participant
          (e.g., the participant, the environment where you conducted the test,
          why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol,
          and the roles of each team member who participated in the test).</li>
          <li>Briefly discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself.
          This should include at least one part of your method that was especially effective
          or one revision you decided to make to your testing process.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Present a table or list of results from your three usability tests.
          We expect you will report at least <strong>three</strong> identified incidents, which may be small or large.
          You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
          This may include incidents you previously reported from your first usability test,
          but may also be completely different in order to focus on the most important incidents you want to report.
          For each critical incident, include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
          <li>Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.</li>
          <li>For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
          <li>For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.</li>
          <li>For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process.
          Your design may have changed more or less,
          so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
          As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each task.
          Include both:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>
          <li>Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be your most salient and important modifications
          based on issues identified in inspection, usability testing, or critique.
          These may already be included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Discuss at least one revision you made to promote inclusivity in your design.
          Describe an unintentional assumption you identified in your design,
          then describe how you revised your design to address this assumption.
          If you are unable to identify this before this submission is due,
          you may discuss this more in section and submit a revised assignment adding this.</p>
          </li>
          </ul><p>As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
          you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of documenting those changes.
          Your goals in this documentation are to:</p><ul>
          <li>Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.</li>
          <li>Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and presentation.</li>
          </ul><p>You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document enough for these two goals.</p>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to transition your prototype into a digital mockup of your design.</p><p>Create your digital mockup based on your final paper prototype.
          Do not begin working in digital prototyping until you finish revising your paper prototype.
          It is much easier to iterate on your design in the paper prototyping phase.</p><p>As you transition into digital prototyping, you will need to consider other aspects of the design.
          This can include detail you may not have previously considered (e.g., visual design, layout, color, typography),
          but can also include constraints or mismatches introduced by the technology itself.
          Note decisions or changes you need to make as you transition from paper to a digital representation.</p><p>The mockup should effectively communicate your design in a manner appropriate for your web content, presentation, and poster.
          Implement your digital mockup to include key frames that illustrate your design.
          It should convey all critical aspects of your design, including walkthroughs for your two primary tasks.</p><p>We have no strong preference regarding what digital tools you use to create your mockup.
          But it must be digital (e.g., you may not use pictures of a hand-drawn sketch).
          Some tools support creation of interactive mockups (e.g., allow clicking active regions to move between screens).
          You are welcome to use such a tool, and such interactivity may be helpful.
          But interactive mockups are neither expected nor required.</p><p>Figma is a widely-used web-based collaborative tool:</p><ul>
