        <p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial paper prototype that will begin to allow testing of your design.</p>
        <p>Develop a paper prototype for your design.
        It should convey critical components of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Include an overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>

          <li>The prototype should be complete for each task,
          including enough detail to show how to complete each step in the task.
          This should include the desired / expected / intended path, but also likely error conditions
          (e.g., what happens if some participant input is invalid?).</li>

          <li>The prototype should be at an appropriate level of detail,
          supporting understanding of critical components of your design and the context of the your primary tasks.</li>

          <li>The documentation in your report should explain how the components of your prototype are related.
          This should include detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This prototype has been informed by your prior sketching and storyboarding.
        But it also contains more details than your prior exploratory designs.
        If necessary or appropriate, revise your tasks or scenarios based on what you learn in prototyping.</p>

        <p>We recommend you do these on paper, then capture a high-quality image (e.g., avoid shadows).
        You may alternatively use an informal drawing tool,
        but be sure you do not adopt a tool that will start to embed unnecessary assumptions or decisions in your design process.</p>

        <p>If you use an informal drawing tool,
        you will need to have physical copies of your paper prototype throughout upcoming milestones.
        You will also need the ability to quickly iterate on your paper prototype.</p>

        <h4>Not Your Average Piece of Paper</h4>

        <p>This is not formally an EXtension Objective, but rather a tip that <b>this is a <i>great</i> assignment to put some extra effort into to get an EXP for an "EXceptional Submission"!</b></p>

        <p>Since everyone's paper prototypes will naturally look very different from each other, we can't really specify exactly what features would achieve this "extra mile"; but some features you might bake into your paper prototype to improve its quality include:</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b>Interactions that go beyond what you can usually do with paper,</b> e.g. incorporating update-able components via transparencies, post-its, etc.</p>
          <p><b>Clever representations of interactive UI elements,</b> e.g. a working carousel image display or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/pickers" target="_blank">Wheel Picker</a>.</p>
          <p><b>A supplemental component related to indicating the context of the interaction / representing real-world variables that exist beyond your interface</b>, e.g. depicting the current state of environment through an image backdrop.</p>
        </ul>

        <h5>Submission Details</h5>
        <p>If you choose to develop additional components beyond what's strictly required for the assignment, consider including a supplemental PDF document in your submission just highlighting these "Added Features", including details on how you implemented them, what they add to the prototype interaction, etc.</p>
