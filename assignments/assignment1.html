        <p>The goal of this milestone is to help get you started in thinking of some ideas for a potential projects. Friday's section will then build on these in brainstorming additional potential directions for project proposals.</p>

        <p>This quarter, you will be working on a project related to <strong>"Designing for Inclusion: Making systems more inclusive and approachable to new audiences."</strong> For this first assignment, you'll be coming up with <strong>three distinct problems</strong> you'd be interested in exploring with your design project.</p>

        <p>As you begin to brainstorm ideas, consider the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How do existing systems currently <i>exclude</i> certain audiences?</li>
          <li>How can we make it easier for a new person to engage with a system for the first time?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Task:</h3>
        <p>Come up with three distinct problems that involve a particular <strong>audience</strong> being excluded by the design of a <strong>system</strong>. Recall that "exclusion" can mean a lot of things here, including</p>
        <ol>
          <li>An individual being unable to engage with the system in their desired way</li>
          <li>A system having "mismatched values" from the person using it</li>
          <li>A system making it more difficult or uncomfortable for certain audiences to interact (relative to other audiences)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Also recall that our working definition of "system" includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specific technologies (eg, a particular smart device or application)</li>
          <li>A combination of Technology + Context (eg, a library printer, a smartwatch used for fitness tracking, an Alexa in an older adult's home)</li>
          <li>A Sociotechnical System or "context where people interact with technology" (eg, physical spaces like "a library", social contexts like "the CSE student community", process- or goal-oriented contexts like "learning Mandarin" or "getting in shape")</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For each problem, come up with a 1-2 sentence summary describing <strong>the audience, the system, and what the problem actually is</strong>.</p>

        <p>Across your 3 ideas, you must consider <strong>at least 2 different audiences</strong> and <strong>at least 2 different systems.</strong></p>

        <details id="1b">
        <summary>
          <table class="assignment-header">
            <tr>
              <td class="assigment-summary">
                <h3>EXtension Objectives</h3>
              </td>
              <td class="accordion-expand">
                <p style="font-size: large;">▼</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </summary>
        <h4>Idea Grid (1EXP)</h4>
        <p>For this Extension Objective, you'll be taking your 3 initial ideas and doing a small brainstorming activity with them. You'll then briefly reflect on the ideas produced by the activity and select your 3 best/favorite ideas for your final 1a submission.</p>

        <h5>Brainstorming Activity</h5>
        <p><i>Note: Make sure you've completed the main portion of 1a first!</i></p>

        <p>To start, make a 3x3 grid. Label the columns with the three systems you identified in the first part of the Assignment (one system per column). Do the same for the rows, but with the three audiences you identified (one audience per row). If you only came up with 2 systems or 2 audiences in your initial brainstorm, come up with a third system that is relevant to one of your audiences (or vice versa).</p>

        <p>You should now have a grid that looks something like this:</p>
        <table class="floating-rc-labels" style="text-align: right;">
          <tr class="rc-label" style="text-align: center;">
            <td></td>
            <td>System A</td>
            <td>System B</td>
            <td>System C</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="rc-label">Audience A</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="rc-label">Audience B</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="rc-label">Audience C</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <br>

        <p>The nine cells in this 3x3 grid each represent a <i>potential</i> problem space, where Audience X interacts with System Y. You should already have three of these ideas generated from the first part of the assignment– go ahead and fill those three cells in with the problem you identified in each space.</p>

        <p>Now, your goal is to identify a problem in each of the 6 remaining problem spaces. For the remaining combinations of System X Audience, consider how the design of the System excludes or fails to consider the Audience and fill in that cell with a relevant problem.</p>

        <p>However, be warned: some combinations of System X Audience don't have meaningful problems to explore! For each idea you generate, note how confident you are that this is a "real" problem worth exploring. If you really can't think of any problems (eg, your pairing is "Student Loan Program" X "Billionaires"), feel free to note that instead.</p>

        <p>Once you've generated your 6 additional ideas, review your set of 9 ideas and select the three you find most compelling.</p>

        <h5>Submission</h5>
        For this Extension Objective, you'll submit the following (in addition to your original 1a submission):
        <ul>
          <li>Your completed 3x3 Idea Grid (either digitally represented or as a photo).</li>
          <li>A 1-2 sentence description of each additional "problem" generated through this exercise, including your thoughts on whether this is a "real" problem.</li>
          <li>Your final set of 3 ideas selected after the exercise.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Please upload this to Canvas as an additional document in your 1a submission.</strong></p>

        </details>

        <br>

        <p>If you are unable to access the submission system, submit by sending your assignment to the staff email address.</p>

        <h3>In Class</h3>
        <p>Be prepared to contribute your initial ideas as part of a larger brainstorm.</p>

        <p>Bring a printed copy of your submission, or otherwise have it readily available (e.g., as a photo on your phone).</p>

        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of 3 points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Each Unique Proposed Idea: (3 x 1 point)</p>
            <p>Do not submit small variations on the same idea.</p>

            <p>Be clear what system and audience you're considering, and communicate how the system's design excludes or creates a negative experience for that audience.</p>

            <p>Across your three ideas, you must consider at least two distinct systems and two distinct audiences.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider communities and systems that are important or relevant to you– having background context of a space can open some great opportunities for clever design! (It also often leads to you enjoying your project more, which makes these assignments a lot more pleasant.)</li>
          <li>Be careful not to go <i>too</i> niche with your problems– ideally, you want your topic to be something people are familiar with or can understand from a quick one-or-two-sentence description.</li>
          <li>Make sure there's a space for <i>human-centered</i> design work in each proposal– be careful not to go too technical (eg, rather than saying "AI is biased and we should fix that," you might consider <i>specific contexts</i> where people use AI and encounter its biases). Also keep the scope of this course in mind– you're not going to be able to solve the climate crisis in a quarter.</li>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to propose multiple specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class. Tuesday and Friday will then include presenting these for feedback from peers and course staff.</p>

        <p>Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the course theme and could form the basis of a design project for this class.</p>

        <p>For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering. State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.</p>

        <p>Ensure each problem or idea is significantly different, not small variations on the same problem or idea.</p>

        <p>Ensure it is clear why each problem or idea is potentially related to the course theme.</p>

        <p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>

        <p>After receiving critique on Tuesday, update your proposals ahead of additional critique on Friday.</p>

        <p>As part of prompting you to deeply engage with and consider critique, your submitted revision must completely modify at least one of your original ideas (e.g., replacing at least one idea with a completely different idea, completely re-writing an idea to emphasize a different perspective).</p>

        <h3>Submission Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No more than one page of text in PDF format.</li>

          <li>This is a group submission. Ensure your section and names of all group participants are appropriately clear.</li>

          <li>Because groups are still potentially evolving, we have not yet created Canvas project groups. Ensure at least one member of your group individually submits, then we will ensure everybody named in the submission receives credit.</li>

          <li>Review and follow guidance on <a href="./index.html#clarity-and-presentation">Clarity and Presentation.</a></li>

          <li>All group members need to <a href="https://forms.gle/8nJ8W7whcom2sq5u7">submit a Contribution Statement</a></li>

          <li>After receiving critique on Tuesday, submit an updated version. In the same document, also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).</li>

          <li>Submit via Canvas here: <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1718569/assignments/9121980">Canvas - Assignment 1b</a></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>In Class</h3>
        <p>Be prepared to discuss your three proposed problems.</p>

        <p>Bring several printed copies of your submission, so you can easily share them with peers for critique.</p>

        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of 10 points:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Problem and Motivation for Each Unique Proposed Idea: (3 x 2 points)</li>

          <p>Do not submit small variations on the same idea.</p>

          <p>Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.</p>

          <p>Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.</p>

          <p>Completely modify at least one idea as part of revision after initial critique.</p>

          <li>Novelty and Creativity: (2 points)</li>

          <p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>

          <li>Clarity and Presentation: (2 points)</li>

          <p>In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement, also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).</p>

          <p>We will primarily grade the revised version of your submission, but may also apply a penalty if the original submission was severely underdeveloped or otherwise problematic.</p>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to propose and analyze a problem that will form the basis of a design project for this class. You should build upon the feedback you have received from peers and course staff. Although your project will iterate and evolve from this point, your group should have coalesced around an idea.</p>

        <p>In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice. Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.</p>

        <p>In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling. Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims. If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.</p>

        <p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>

        <h3>Submission Details</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>Submitting a finalized project proposal as part of a group is a requirement for proceeding in the class.</p>

        <p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of 10 points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Problem and Motivation: (3 points)</li>
