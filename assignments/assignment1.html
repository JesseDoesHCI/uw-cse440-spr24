        <p>The goal of this milestone is to propose multiple specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class. Tuesday and Friday will then include presenting these for feedback from peers and course staff.</p>

        <p>Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the course theme and could form the basis of a design project for this class.</p>

        <p>For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering. State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.</p>

        <p>Ensure each problem or idea is significantly different, not small variations on the same problem or idea.</p>

        <p>Ensure it is clear why each problem or idea is potentially related to the course theme.</p>

        <p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>

        <p>After receiving critique on Tuesday, update your proposals ahead of additional critique on Friday.</p>

        <p>As part of prompting you to deeply engage with and consider critique, your submitted revision must completely modify at least one of your original ideas (e.g., replacing at least one idea with a completely different idea, completely re-writing an idea to emphasize a different perspective).</p>

        <h3>Submission Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No more than one page of text in PDF format.</li>

          <li>This is a group submission. Ensure your section and names of all group participants are appropriately clear.</li>

          <li>Because groups are still potentially evolving, we have not yet created Canvas project groups. Ensure at least one member of your group individually submits, then we will ensure everybody named in the submission receives credit.</li>

          <li>Review and follow guidance on Clarity and Presentation.</li>

          <li>Submit a Contribution Statement as an additional separate PDF.</li>

          <li>After receiving critique on Tuesday, submit an updated version. In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement, also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).</li>

          <li>Submit via Canvas here: <a href="">CANVAS LINK TBD</a></li>
          
          <li>After receiving critique on Tuesday, submit an updated version via Canvas here: <a href="">CANVAS LINK TBD</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In Class</h3>
        <p>Be prepared to discuss your three proposed problems.</p>

        <p>Bring several printed copies of your submission, so you can easily share them with peers for critique.</p>

        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of 10 points:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Problem and Motivation for Each Unique Proposed Idea: (3 x 2 points)</li>

          <p>Do not submit small variations on the same idea.</p>

          <p>Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.</p>

          <p>Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.</p>

          <p>Completely modify at least one idea as part of revision after initial critique.</p>

          <li>Novelty and Creativity: (2 points)</li>

          <p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>

          <li>Clarity and Presentation: (2 points)</li>

          <p>In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement, also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).</p>

          <p>We will primarily grade the revised version of your submission, but may also apply a penalty if the original submission was severely underdeveloped or otherwise problematic.</p>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to propose and analyze a problem that will form the basis of a design project for this class. You should build upon the feedback you have received from peers and course staff. Although your project will iterate and evolve from this point, your group should have coalesced around an idea.</p>

        <p>In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice. Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.</p>

        <p>In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling. Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims. If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.</p>

        <p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>

        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>Submitting a finalized project proposal as part of a group is a requirement for proceeding in the class.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Problem and Motivation: (3 points)</li>
