      <h1>EXP Weekly: Redesign of the Week</h1>

      <!-- Edit main page content -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Good design requires reflection-- but unfortunately, at the pace of a CSE class on a quarter system, there's rarely an opportunity (or an incentive) to pause and reflect on your work and consider what you would do differently, given the chance... until now!</p>
      
      <p>The goal of this Weekly is to give you a chance to reflect on previous milestones and apply newly developed insights, feedback you received in Crit, and so on. Starting Week 2, there will be a different prompt each week related to a previous project milestone.</p>
      <p>Even though the milestones are (generally) group submissions, <b>these reflections will be individual submissions</b>. Though we won't share your reflections with your groupmates, we do encourage you to share your insights with your group and apply them in future milestones!</p>

      <h3>Submission</h3>
      <p>Due: Week N's prompt can be responded to until 11:59pm on Tuesday of Week N+2.</p> 
      
      <p>Your reflection should be somewhere between 1/2 page to 1 page, in PDF format.</p>

      <h3>Grading</h3>
      <p>If your submission meaningfully engages with that week's prompt and questions, you will receive <strong>0.5EXP</strong>.</p>

        <p>Last week, you were battered with a barrage of content around HCI basics, inclusive design, and brainstorming-- and along the way, you managed to come up with some project ideas for Assignment 1a, too!</p>

        <p>With what you know now: address <b>one</b> of the following prompts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Take a fresh look at your 1a submissions. Even when we have good intentions, we sometimes propose design projects that, in retrospect, have their own flaws. If you find that any of your proposed 1a ideas are something you might not propose now, reflect on 1) what was wrong with the idea, and 2) why and how you might revise that idea to be a more thoughtful space to explore.</li>
          <li>Week 1 Section was a whirlwind– as with any good brainstorming activity, there were probably some decent ideas that came up that "got left on the cutting room floor" (i.e., you liked them but just chose not to go with them for whatever reason). Share one or two of those ideas and talk about both 1) the merits of the idea (i.e., what would be interesting to explore with that topic?) and 2) the reasons you didn't end up going forward with it.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For either prompt, your answer should be between 1/2 - 1 page of text in PDF format.</p>

        <p>Last week, you proposed, critiqued, revised, and critiqued (again) project ideas, ultimately selecting one of your proposals as your project topic for the quarter.</p>

        <p>However, just because you selected one idea doesn't mean the unselected ideas were bad! For this week's Redesign, you'll reflect on (at least) one of the topics you did NOT choose from 1b/1b_rev, and consider what it could've looked like as an actual project.</p>

        <p>Select one of your unselected 1b/1b_rev topics and answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What was your initial interest in this topic? Was there anything about it that excited you?</li>
          <li>Why did you ultimately choose the topic you did select instead of this one?</li>
          <li>Suppose you did select this topic. What are 2 research questions you would want to explore in your Design Research?</li>
          <li>Finally, reflecting on what excited you about this idea and the research questions you generated: what ideas from this topic can you bring with you into the design topic you DID select? For example:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Is there a way to explore the things that excited you in this topic in your current project?</li>
            <li>Are the research questions you've come up with relevant to your current project?</li>
            <li>If there's truly nothing you want to take from this idea: what from this topic can you be sure to AVOID in your current project, to make sure you don't end up repeating past mistakes?</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>


        <p>Your response can be one large writeup that addresses all the questions, or you can respond directly to each question. Your submission should be between 1/2 - 1 page of text in PDF format.</p>

        <p><b>Note: This Redesign prompt is easier to answer once you've completed <i>all</i> your design research sessions and completed Assignment 2d, but you can still answer it having only done part of your design research.</b></p>
        
        <p>Welcome to the Wild World of Design Research! Design Research is certainly a learned skill, as is conducting design research sessions (interviews, CI's, etc.)-- as a result, there's plenty to reflect on around how individual DR sessions went.</p>

        <p>For this week's Redesign, you'll be reflecting on your Design Research sessions and thinking about what worked well and what didn't.</p>

        <p>Considering all the Design Research sessions you've been involved in, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What session do you think was most "successful"? What defines "success" in this context for you, and what made this session particularly successful?</li>
          <li>What session was least successful? What, if anything, went wrong that caused this session to be less successful than the others?</li>
          <li>Consider the specific details of your methods and how you executed them. If you were to do it all over again, what changes would you make to your methods and execution to improve the quality of your research sessions?</li>
          <li>Consider your recruitment and how you engaged with your participants. Were you to do it all over, would you change your recruitment in any way or change how you engaged with your participants? Is there a "dream participant" you wish you could have recruited for your research?</li>
        </ol>


        <p>Your submission should be approximately 1 page of text in PDF format.</p>

        <p><b>Note: I'd recommend waiting until you get your 2e feedback before engaging with this prompt, though you <i>can</i> still answer it before receiving feedback. (But the work you do here could actually be useful if you need to update your tasks for 2f!)</b></p>
        
        <p>Congrats on finishing up your Design Research! By this point, you should have some Tasks generated and maybe even a Design or two proposed, which is very exciting– but let's not move past the Design Research just yet.</p>

        <p>For this week's Redesign, you'll be reflecting on your Design Research and thinking about what "didn't make the cut"– that is, <b>what parts of your Design Research didn't get worked into your final set of Insights in 2d or didn't make it into a Task in 2e?</b></p>

        <p>Considering all the raw data you acquired in your Design Research and your subsequent analysis, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What are two insights you gained from your Design Research that got cut (i.e., you didn't ultimately select it as one of your 2d Insights OR you didn't incorporate it into a Task in 2e)? Why did this insight get cut?</li>
          <li>Considering your "cut" insights from Question 1: what might it look like to incorporate these insights into your current design ideation? Are there changes you might make to your proposed tasks or designs if you were to focus on this insight?</li>
          <li>What is one <i>off topic or "out of scope"</i> insight you could derive from your Design Research? (For instance: did a Participant indicate the need for a larger structural change beyond what you can handle in this course? was there discussion of related-but-not-quite-on-topic needs?) In what design context might that off topic insight be useful?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Your submission should be approximately 1 page of text in PDF format. <b>Please include the name or week number of the prompt you're responding to at the top of your document.</b></p>

        <p>Last week, you developed, critiqued, revised, and critiqued (again) three designs, ultimately selecting one as your design for the remainder of the quarter.</p>

        <p>However, just because you selected one design doesn't mean the unselected designs were bad! For this week's Redesign, you'll reflect on the two designs you did NOT choose from 2f/2f_rev, and consider what aspects of it you might want to carry into the design you did select.</p>

        <p>For each of your unselected 2f designs, answer the following questions:</p>
        <p style="color: gray;"><i>Note: if you ultimately combined multiple 2f designs into your 2g design, answer these questions for two of your original 2f designs of your choice.</i></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Briefly describe the design, what it did, and what it accomplished that your selected design did not.</li>
          <li>Why did you ultimately choose the design you did select instead of this one?</li>
          <li>Discuss two <b>design tradeoffs.</b> Is there a way you can you account for this tradeoff in your selected design?</li>
