      <h1>EXP Weekly: Redesign of the Week</h1>

      <!-- Edit main page content -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Good design requires reflection-- but unfortunately, at the pace of a CSE class on a quarter system, there's rarely an opportunity (or an incentive) to pause and reflect on your work and consider what you would do differently, given the chance... until now!</p>
      
      <p>The goal of this Weekly is to give you a chance to reflect on previous milestones and apply newly developed insights, feedback you received in Crit, and so on. Starting Week 2, there will be a different prompt each week related to a previous project milestone.</p>
      <p>Even though the milestones are (generally) group submissions, <b>these reflections will be individual submissions</b>. Though we won't share your reflections with your groupmates, we do encourage you to share your insights with your group and apply them in future milestones!</p>

      <h3>Submission</h3>
      <p>Due: Each week by 11:59pm on Saturday.</p> 
      <p>There's a one-week grace period on these: if you miss Week 2's deadline, you have until the Week 3 deadline to get your redesign in, and so on.</p>

      <p>Your reflection should be somewhere between 1/2 page to 1 page, in PDF format.</p>

      <h3>Grading</h3>
      <p>If your submission meaningfully engages with that week's prompt and questions, you will receive <strong>0.5EXP</strong>.</p>

        <p>Last week, you were battered with a barrage of content around HCI basics, inclusive design, and brainstorming-- and along the way, you managed to come up with some project ideas for Assignment 1a, too!</p>

        <p>With what you know now: address <b>one</b> of the following prompts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Take a fresh look at your 1a submissions. Even when we have good intentions, we sometimes propose design projects that, in retrospect, have their own flaws. If you find that any of your proposed 1a ideas are something you might not propose now, reflect on 1) what was wrong with the idea, and 2) why and how you might revise that idea to be a more thoughtful space to explore.</li>
          <li>Week 1 Section was a whirlwind– as with any good brainstorming activity, there were probably some decent ideas that came up that "got left on the cutting room floor" (i.e., you liked them but just chose not to go with them for whatever reason). Share one or two of those ideas and talk about both 1) the merits of the idea (i.e., what would be interesting to explore with that topic?) and 2) the reasons you didn't end up going forward with it.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For either prompt, your answer should be between 1/2 - 1 page of text in PDF format.</p>
        <p>Submit via Canvas here: <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1718569/assignments/9191729">Canvas - EXP Redesign of the Week</a></p>
