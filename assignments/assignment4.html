        <p>The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
      and your underlying design process in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.</p><p>Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design and then getting the design right.
      Your post will be integrated into the course website via the
      <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/24sp/projects#projects" target="_blank">Projects</a> page,
      used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
      Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
      but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
      Not all content from prior milestones will be included,
      you should update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process
      (e.g., re-making a design sketch or storyboard for clarity in this communication),
      and you will ultimately emphasize a few key insights that most informed your design.</p><p>Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
      Re-make images as necessary to ensure this
      (e.g., by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner,
      by re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).</p><p>Remember that audience is important in storytelling,
      and be sure your post takes a tone of "presenting" and "reflecting" on your project.
      You are not "selling" the resulting design, but are instead "sharing" your work with an interested audience.
      You can express enthusiasm, but do not let that enthusiasm undermine the substance of your content.</p><p>Your post should follow the outline below.
      It will be authored using Markdown and provided components for including images.
      Be sure to inspect and understand the template text provided in your project directory.</p><ol>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Title and Logo</strong></p>
      <p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
      <p>An attractive project logo. It will be used to link to your project from the main projects page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Problem and Design Overview</strong>:</p>
      <p>Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your design.</p>
      <p>This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs.
      You should likely include an image to help build interest.
      Your goal is to set a context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about your work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Design Research Process and Key Insights</strong>:</p>
      <p><em>Design Research Process</em></p>
      <p>First provide a concise overview of your design research process in Assignment 2, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding).</li>
      <li>The methods and participants you engaged in your design research.</li>
      <li>Your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and participants).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.</p>
      <p>This might be a single paragraph.</p>
      <p><em>3 Key Insights</em></p>
      <p>Then provide 3 key insights from your design research process in Assignment 2.
      Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
      (e.g., how your understanding was shaped by design research,
      how your understanding was shaped by critique or feedback).</li>
      <li>Use specific evidence whenever possible
      (e.g., quotes or stories from participants,
      pictures captured during observations,
      pivots in your approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback,
      key reasons you chose one design over alternatives,
      key reasons you combined ideas from multiple design alternatives).</li>
      <li>Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3").
      Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Minimizing Burden", "Creating Social Connections")
      or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.</li>
      <li>Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your design sketches or storyboards).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive heading.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Iterative Design Process and Key Insights</strong>:</p>
      <p><em>Iterative Design Process</em></p>
      <p>First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in Assignment 3, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Your design focus (i.e., the tasks on which you focused iterative design).</li>
      <li>Your process (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability testing, and digital mockup).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.</p>
      <p>This might be a single paragraph.
      You should likely include an overview image of your paper prototype.</p>
      <p><em>3 Key Insights</em></p>
      <p>Then provide 3 key insights from your iterative design process in Assignment 3.
      Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
      (e.g., the state of a design element prior to the insight,
      the activity, observation, critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design element,
      an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required re-working your design)
      and how you iterated upon the design in result
      (e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).</li>
      <li>Use specific evidence whenever possible
      (e.g., quotes from or observations of participants).</li>
      <li>Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3").
      Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Simplifying Data Collection", "Improving Legibility", "Removing Gender Assumptions")
      or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.</li>
      <li>Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive heading.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Resulting Design</strong>:</p>
      <p>Present key elements of your final design.
      Convey the critical aspects of your design,
      including the two primary tasks demonstrated in your digital mockup
      (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task with images from your digital mockup).</p>
      <p>This section may primarily be a set of images,
      but be sure you organize those images with enough text for a reader to understand the resulting design.</p>
      </li>
      </ol><h4>Submission</h4><p>Evidence from Medium suggests that effective posts can be read in approximately 7 minutes:</p><p><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineAlways mui-lzlwdt" href="https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b</a></p><p>Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes.
      We estimate posts will be between 1500 and 2000 words in length.</p><p>Be sure:</p><ul>
      <li>
      <p>This is a group submission. Ensure your section and names of all group participants are appropriately clear.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      <span><a>Contribution Statement</a></span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Names of participants should be replaced with pseudonyms in all documents.
      It is important to protect participant anonymity, even in the case that reporting seems harmless.</p>

      <p>The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.</p><p>Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process.
      Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects.
      Your poster should include:</p><ul>
      <li>Project Title</li>
      <li>Logo</li>
      <li>Your Names</li>
      <li>Problem</li>
      <li>Value Proposition</li>
      <li>Key Functionality</li>
      <li>Key Design Insights</li>
      </ul><p>Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
      For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32"x40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).</p>

      <p>The staff have assembled several templates you can use as a starting point:</p><p class="MuiBox-root mui-0"><a class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineAlways mui-lzlwdt" href="https://www.figma.com/file/fK3x9CC0ZGXxjvvSfHg2t9/CSE440-Poster-Example-%26-Template?type=design&amp;node-id=0%3A1&amp;mode=design&amp;t=4hrUv6ue9a5HxeXn-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma Templates</a></p><p><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/24wi/assignments/poster-template-a-32x40.pptx">Powerpoint Template A</a></p><p><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/24wi/assignments/poster-template-b-32x40.pptx">Powerpoint Template B</a></p><p><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/24wi/assignments/poster-template-c-32x40.pptx">Powerpoint Template C</a></p>

      <p>You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.</p><p>Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
      Re-make images as necessary to ensure this
      (e.g., by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner,
