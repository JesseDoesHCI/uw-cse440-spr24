        <p>The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.</p>
        <p>Generate 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).</li>
          <li>Data: types of data a design might track or utilize in some way.</li>
          <li>Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.</li>
          <li>Features: a specific capability a design might have.</li>
          <li>Interaction scenarios: contexts where someone might interact with a design related to your proposal (e.g., physical environments, social settings, related activities they might be performing, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide sheets of paper to help structure this brainstorm. Alternatively, <a href="../files/res/2a-form.docx" target="_blank">here's the template in Word Doc form.</a>
        Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
        A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.</p>
        <p>The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
        Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
        You may include ideas from existing products, but no two ideas should be alike.
        When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.</p>

        <p>After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
        Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas in such directions, which you will do via design research. 
        However, as we have previously discussed: high quality design research requires thoughtful planning and reflection on what you do and don't already know.</p>

        <p>Reflecting on your ideas from the brainstorming activity AND the process of generating them, address the following questions (1-2 sentences per question) for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each</span> of the 5 brainstorming categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How difficult was it to come up with 10 distinct ideas in this category?</li>
          <li>Are there ideas in this category that you're particularly excited about? What makes them exciting?</li>
          <li>How confident are you that all your ideas in this category are "meaningful"? Are there specific ideas that you feel unsure about (e.g., tasks you're not sure a user would actually want to perform, features you aren't sure are actually useful, etc.)?</li>
          <li><strong>Based on your answers to the above: what specific topics does this suggest could be valuable to explore in your design research?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Submission and Grading</h3>
        <p>There is no <i>required</i> submission for this milestone.</p>

        <h4>Design Ideation Mad Libs &amp; Sketching (1EXP)</h4>
        <p><b>Note: Before starting this Extension Objective, make sure you 1) have fully completed the above ideation task, and 2) have taken a high-quality picture or scan of each brainstorming page.</b></p>

        <p>The goal of this Extension Objective is to take your design ideation one step further by starting to conceptualize how different design elements might come together.</p>

        <p><i>Note: this first step is optional, but makes the rest of the assignment work better. You'll see what I mean. -JM</i></p>

        <p>First off, cut out each of the 10 design ideas on one of your Ideation sheets by cutting along the printed lines of the table. Repeat for all 5 sheets to produce 50 individual cards, keeping each sheet's set of 10 in its own pile. (Note: if using the colored sheets provided in class, these should be easy enough to group by category; if you reprinted the sheets yourself, you'll want to either mark your cards somehow or just be careful not to mix things up.)</p>

        <p>Once you have your 5 sets of 10 cards, it's time to play some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs" target="_blank">Mad Libs</a>! Your goal here is to come up with 3 potential designs that each consist of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Form</li>
          <li>At least 1 type of Data</li>
          <li>At least 2 Tasks</li>
          <li>At least 2 Features</li>
          <li>At least 1 Interaction Context</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Optional (Recommended) Additional Constraints:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No card can be reused across multiple of your 3 designs</li>
          <li>For at least 1 of your designs, try selecting at least 1 card <b>at random</b> from each of the categories.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that a random assortment of cards does NOT necessarily compose a design! Think critically about which cards you group together-- <i>does this actually create a meaningful design? can these aspects coexist in a way that doesn't just create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee" target="_blank">Camel</a>?</i></p>

        <p>Once you have a set of cards to characterize a design, it's time to do your first design sketches of the quarter!</p>

        <p><b>For each design, sketch out what the design looks like and how it works, being sure to highlight each of the elements described on the selected cards.</b> (For User Tasks, consider labeling the parts of it that let a user accomplish their Task, such as highlighting the handle on a coffee mug to demonstrate the User Task of "carry coffee between locations")</p>

        <p><b>Finally, once you've sketched your designs, briefly reflect on the following for each design:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>What parts of this design do you like?</li>
          <li>What are 2 questions this design raises that you might explore in your Design Research?</li>
          <ul>
            <li><i>For example: would people actually be interested in using a [FORM, eg, wearable] in [CONTEXT, eg, shopping at the supermarket]?</i></li>
          </ul>
        </ul>


        <h5>Submission</h5>

        <p><b>Please compose a document that includes the following:</b></p>
        <p>For each design:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The "prompt" you constructed (ie, the selected cards for that design), styled as a Mad Libs (fill in the blanks) in the following style:</li>
          
          <p>Design [#]: A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">__FORM__</span> that utilizes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">__DATA__</span> to support users in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">__TASKS__</span> while in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">__CONTEXT__</span>. It does this through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">__FEATURES__</span>.</p>
        
          <p><i>(Feel free to rework the sentence as desired, as long as it's still clear which parts fall in which categories.)</i></p>

          <li>A high-quality image of your sketch.</li>
          <li>The answers to the 2 reflection questions (1-2 sentences per question).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
        encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
        and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.</p>
        <p>As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
        (e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
        to learn from at least <strong>three</strong> people who might use your design.</p>
        <p>In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design.
        If other people are also likely impacted by a design, also describe these other stakeholders to consider.
        Among potential stakeholders, describe the <strong>participants</strong> you plan to pursue,
        including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a specific group of doctors
          (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
          Other stakeholders might include patients of the clinic, nurses in the clinic, or non-medical staff in the clinic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Describe your <strong>recruitment plan</strong> in enough detail to convince us that you can find and engage with your target participants in the next week.
        Whether you intend to target participants that are relatively difficult to access (e.g., as with busy doctors)
        or more readily available (e.g., undergraduate students at the University of Washington),
        describe your planned recruitment activities,
        and when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.
        Additionally describe any steps you have already taken to recruit,
        and your plans to recover if recruitment is not initially successful in the necessary timeline.</p>
        <p>In another paragraph, describe the <strong>specific design research method(s)</strong>
        you will use to engage with and learn from these people and your rationale for choosing these method(s).
        A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
        However, we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs
        (e.g., you are welcome but not required to propose to combine multiple methods).
        Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.</li>
          <li>If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.</li>
          <li>If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
          what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
          and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.</li>
          <li>If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.</li>
          <li>If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research,
        reflect on what you observe and learn,
        then update your plans for additional design research.</p>
        <p>Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
        You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
        but also about effectively conducting your design research.</p>
        <p>Describe your first design research participant and your findings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What did you do?
          <ul>
            <li>Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What did you learn?
          <ul>
            <li>List <strong>six</strong> specific findings based on what you observed or learned.</li>
            <li>For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We expect findings will be short but concrete.
        For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
        where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
        and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.</p>
        <p>Then discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
        We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
        can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.</p>
        <ul>

          </table>
        </summary>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
        organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.</p>
        <h3>Identifying Themes</h3>
        <p>Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:</p><ul>
        <li>What did you do?
        <ul>
        <li>Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What did you learn?
        <ul>
        <li>List <strong>at least eight</strong> specific findings based on what you observed or learned.</li>
        <li>For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We expect findings will be short but concrete.
        For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
        where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
        and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.</p>
        <p>Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for relatively few additional findings.
        We expect you will curate your findings
        (e.g., to focus on those which are most interesting,
        to convey the range of things you learned,
        to emphasize key themes you have identified).
        Some of your specific findings therefore might also have been reported in Assignment 2c,
        but others will be new and the overall set will be curated with a focus on advancing your project.</p>
        <p>Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Identify at least two themes or high-level insights that are suggested by your findings across multiple participants.</li>
        <li>Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are important to design for?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and design opportunities,
        it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
        Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
        ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.</p>
        <h3>Task Analysis Questions</h3>
        <p>Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following questions.
        These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Who is going to use the design?</li>
          <li>What tasks do they now perform?</li>
          <li>What tasks are desired?</li>
          <li>How are the tasks learned?</li>
          <li>Where are the tasks performed?</li>
          <li>What is the relationship between the person and data?</li>
          <li>What other tools does the person have?</li>
          <li>How do people communicate with each other?</li>
          <li>How often are the tasks performed?</li>
          <li>What are the time constraints on the tasks?</li>
          <li>What happens when things go wrong?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in a set of potential designs.</p><p>Building on what you learned in your design research, design <strong>six tasks</strong> that you believe are important to your design goal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.</li>
          <li>Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of designs you will explore.</li>
          <li>Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do)
          as well as your vision for new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your potential designs).</li>
          <li>These should be real world tasks that include details
          (e.g., instead of "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record Spongebob on Sundays").
          Such details can then be explored in scenarios with the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.</li>
          <li>Tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
          Although it can be helpful to describe a task in the context of a specific scenario,
          the task itself should be more general and potentially achieved using multiple potential designs.</li>
          <li>Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each task should be presented as a bolded sentence at the beginning of a paragraph,
        concisely conveying a problem and/or what is accomplished.
        The remainder of the paragraph should then present
        additional details, potential scenarios, or a step-by-step walkthrough with specific designs.</p>
        <p>As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
        Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
        The tasks you develop in this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to develop distinct design ideas that address your tasks.</p><p>You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem.
        You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different <strong>initial designs</strong> for your interface:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.</li>
        <li>Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks.
        A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design.</li>
        <li>These should be rough sketches (i.e., not digital mockups),
        including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend you do these on paper, then capture a high-quality image (e.g., avoid shadows).
        You may alternatively use an informal drawing tool,
        but be sure you do not adopt a tool that will start to embed unnecessary assumptions or decisions in your design process.</p>
        <p>The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
        They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.</p>
        <p>After receiving critique on Thursday, update your designs ahead of additional critique on Friday.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>No more than three pages of text in PDF format, to include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated as needed from prior assignment).
        These should be updated according to feedback and any evolution in your understanding.</li>
        <li>For each of three initial designs:
        <ul>
        <li>The high-level idea of the design (one paragraph).</li>
        <li>Images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups).</li>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to choose a design idea to pursue in the remainder of this course.</p>
        <p>From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course.
        Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement.
        The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design.
        They should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should emphasize long-lived or repeated activities.
        In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application
        is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not sufficiently interesting.</p>
        <p>Prepare one paragraph describing <em>why you selected the design</em> and <em>why you selected the tasks</em> you did.
        Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your design research.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Why this design and these tasks?</li>
        <li>What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting your design?</li>
        <li>Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.</p>
        <p>Then <em>create a storyboard of each task</em> for your selected design.
        Storyboards should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what it will be like,
        conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that
        a person not in your group can understand how the design supports each task.
        They should establish motivation and satisfaction,
        should show insight into the task and design, and should include one or more characters and settings.
        To ensure clarity of your story,
        storyboards should not include any unneeded frames or unnecessary details across multiple frames.
        As needed, ensure clarity of your story through captions,
        other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or other techniques.</p>
        <p>We recommend you do these on paper, then capture a high-quality image (e.g., avoid shadows).
        You may alternatively use an informal drawing tool,
        but be sure you do not adopt a tool that will start to embed unnecessary assumptions or decisions in your design process.</p>
