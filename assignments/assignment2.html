        <p>The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.</p>
        <p>Generate 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).</li>
          <li>Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.</li>
          <li>Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.</li>
          <li>Features: a specific capability a design might have.</li>
          <li>Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design might engage or support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide sheets of paper to help structure this brainstorm.
        Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
        A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.</p>
        <p>The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
        Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
        You may include ideas from existing products, but no two ideas should be alike.
        When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.</p>
        <p>After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
        Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas in such directions.
        Following up on the above, additionally brainstorm:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.</li>
          <li>Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.</li>
          <li>Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
        encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
        and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.</p>
        <p>As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
        (e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
        to learn from at least <strong>three</strong> people who might use your design.</p>
        <p>In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design.
        If other people are also likely impacted by a design, also describe these other stakeholders to consider.
        Among potential stakeholders, describe the <strong>participants</strong> you plan to pursue,
        including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a specific group of doctors
          (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
          Other stakeholders might include patients of the clinic, nurses in the clinic, or non-medical staff in the clinic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Describe your <strong>recruitment plan</strong> in enough detail to convince us that you can find and engage with your target participants in the next week.
        Whether you intend to target participants that are relatively difficult to access (e.g., as with busy doctors)
        or more readily available (e.g., undergraduate students at the University of Washington),
        describe your planned recruitment activities,
        and when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.
        Additionally describe any steps you have already taken to recruit,
        and your plans to recover if recruitment is not initially successful in the necessary timeline.</p>
        <p>In another paragraph, describe the <strong>specific design research method(s)</strong>
        you will use to engage with and learn from these people and your rationale for choosing these method(s).
        A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
        However, we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs
        (e.g., you are welcome but not required to propose to combine multiple methods).
        Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.</li>
          <li>If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.</li>
          <li>If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
          what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
          and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.</li>
          <li>If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.</li>
          <li>If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Submission Details</h4>
        <p>No more than two pages of text in PDF format.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p>This is a group submission. Ensure your section and names of all group participants are appropriately clear.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Review and follow guidance on Clarity and Presentation</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Submit a
          Contribution Statement
          as an additional separate PDF.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Names of participants should be replaced with pseudonyms in all documents.
          It is important to protect participant anonymity, even in the case that reporting seems harmless.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In Class</h3>
        <p>Be prepared to discuss your design research plan.</p><p>Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
        so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.</p>
