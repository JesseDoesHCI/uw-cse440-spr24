      <h1>EXP Weekly: Design Rant of the Week</h1>

      <!-- Edit main page content -->
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Bad design is all around us! Each week, we'll provide a topic or theme, and it'll be your job to look for bad designs "in the wild" related to that prompt.</p>
      <p>Once you've found a bad design, document it as best you can and write up a "rant" that addresses the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What's wrong with this design?</li>
        <li>What principles of good design does this violate?</li>
        <li>What are the consequences of this type of bad design?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on the topic, we may also provide a couple additional or alternate questions for you to consider.</p>

      <p>The form your "rant" takes is up to you-- we'd recommend a casual, first-person, "blog post-style" write-up, but as long as your submission communicates the experience and answers the relevant questions, feel free to capture it in whatever form is most enjoyable to you.</p>

      <p>That's a key detail here-- try to have fun with these! If you've got years of built-up frustration about UW's course registration portal, let it out! If iPhone design choices perplex you, express bewilderment about how multi-billion dollar corporations still make rookie design mistakes! Even small design flaws can have large consequences, so there's no such thing as "too big a reaction" in this assignment.</p>

      <h3>Submission</h3>
      <p>Due: Each week by 11:59pm on Tuesday.</p> 
      <p>There's a one-week grace period on these: if you miss Week 2's deadline, you have until the Week 3 deadline to get your rant in.</p>

      <p>If doing a standard rant, keep it to one page of text in PDF format. If you're playing with a different form, submit what you need, though try to keep your content on par with a page of writing.</p>

      <h3>Grading</h3>
      <p>If your submission meaningfully engages with that week's prompt and questions, you will receive <strong>0.5EXP</strong>.</p>

        <p>Welcome to 440! Inspired by the example of "Norman Doors" from the first lecture, which showed us how even the most lightweight interactions can be poorly designed, we want you to <strong>find things you interact with regularly that you think are poorly designed.</strong></p>
        <p>Alternatively: is there a system or device you just <i>dread</i> interacting with? An object that bothers you every time you have to interact with it? Feel free to explore a lasting grudge like that here instead.</p>
        <p>We don't expect you to have the language just yet to be able to perfectly describe what's wrong with a design, so for this Rant, focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What's the experience like interacting with this Thing? Describe your User Experience as best you can.</li>
          <li>What specific parts or attributes of the Thing make it unpleasant to interact with? Describe how you think they make the User Experience worse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're having trouble coming up with ideas for this Rant, feel free to chat with the course staff-- we're happy to talk through ideas with you!</p>

        <p>This week, we discussed how to thoughtfully engage in the process of Critique, and discussed the 'Ugly Baby Principle'– sometimes we're convinced our ideas are the best thing ever, when the truth is that they're not actually that great.</p>
        <p>For this week's Rant, you'll have the chance to look back at something you've designed / built / created before, and ask the age-old question: is my baby... ugly?</p>
        <p>Revisit something you've created in the past, ideally something you made while at UW but some time has passed since you made it. This can be a piece of code or software you wrote for a CSE course, an essay or project you crafted for a class, a creative piece you produced in any medium– as long as you put genuine effort into its creation, it's fair game. Ideally, pick something that, at the time of it's creation, you were really proud of; but maybe in retrospect, it wasn't as great as you thought. (At the very least, make sure you can see both positives AND negatives of what you created.)</p>
        <p>Your prompt is:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 2em;"><strong>Briefly describe your artifact and then write up a brief critique of it. Discuss what aspects of it "hold up" (i.e., what are the positives?) and what parts of it, in retrospect, could use some more work (i.e., what are the negatives?). Then, briefly describe the experience of critiquing your own design. If you recall how you previously felt about it: now that some time has passed, do you feel any differently about it, looking back with a lens of critique?</strong></p>

        <p>If you are so inclined and it's useful for communicating something, feel free to include a sample of the creation you're critiquing (with the knowledge that the course staff will <i>not</i> be reading an essay you wrote for your Intro to Composition course).</p>

        <p>Your writeup should be between 1/2 page - 1 page long, in PDF format.</p>

        <p style="color: #777;"><i>**Note: This prompt was posted a day late, so it can be submitted through the 24th instead of the expected deadline.</i></p>
        
        <p>This week, we discussed the Design Diamond as a conceptual model for iterative design, emphasizing the importance of a "medium-sized diamond" that includes <i>enough</i> time spent on Elaboration but not <i>too much</i>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, people don't spend enough time coming up with ideas and just pick their first idea (or a comparably ill-informed early-stage idea). This often leads to immature designs that sound fine in theory, but don't work out great in practice.</p>

        <p><b>For this Rant, you'll once again be looking out for designs in the world-- this time, for a design that are "good in theory, awful in practice".</b> To judge this, we'll use the 'sounds good on paper' threshold: imagine a conversation where a designer is trying to describe their idea to someone, but leaves out a few key details that make the difference between 'sure, that could work!' and 'Bob, that's a horrible idea, I'm firing you from the design team' (or maybe just a milder 'that's a bad idea').</p>

        <p>Your Rant must include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What Design you've selected (+ a picture, if you've got one!)</li>
          <li>The problem your selected design attempts to solve.</li>
          <li>The "Sounds Good on Paper" description of your selected design: a description of some aspects of the design that make it sound like it could actually solve the problem.</li>
          <li>The "Reality" description of the design: the "full picture" description of the design that causes it to actually not solve the problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your selected design can be <b>any specific object that was designed by someone</b> (e.g., "the espresso machine at Starbucks" but not "coffee" or "the institution of Starbucks").</p>

        <p>Your writeup should be between 1/2 page - 1 page long, in PDF format.</p>
